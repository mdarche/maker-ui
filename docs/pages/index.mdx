# Overview

Maker UI is a design system that helps you create responsive React apps. Build accessible, production ready layouts in just a few lines of code, or use Maker UI primitives to effortlessly construct responsive components.

Maker UI is unopinionated, meaning that all of its components give you full control over theming and appearance.

## Features

There are 2 ways to use Maker UI:

- CSS-in-JS Primitives
- Layout System

### CSS-in-JS Primitives

All Maker UI components support the responsive `css` and `breakpoints` props. Never write a media query again! You can use style arrays that correspond with breakpoints to build media queries:

```jsx
/** Equivalent CSS:
 * 
 * color: red;
 * @media screen and (min-width: 960px) {
 *    color: blue;
 * }
}*/

<Div breakpoints={[960]} css={{ color: ['red', 'blue'] }}>
  Hello world
</Div>
```

The `css` prop is mobile-first so it writes media queries according to the `min-width` rule. The first index of a style array is the attribute's default value and subsequent styles correspond to screen widths specified in the `breakpoints` prop.

Whenever you want to include responsive styles, just import any component from `@maker-ui/primitives` or `@maker-ui/elements`. They can be used independently of the layout system.

### Layout System

The Layout System gives you global control over your app's skeleton and global breakpoints. You can use its semantic components to build highly custom layouts that scale with zero-configuration.

The Layout provider also gives you granular control over the way certain parts of your app behave. Use a `MakerUIOptions` configuration object to customize the look and feel of your layout:

- 9 customizable desktop header layouts
- 4 customizable mobile header layouts
- 7+ content layouts
- Automatic responsive header and side navigation
- Accessible dropdown menus
- Automatic skiplink and keyboard focus management
- Conditional or multi-layout support
- Unlimited color modes
- Custom CSS variables
- Error boundaries and custom logging hooks

## TypeScript

Maker UI is written in TypeScript and includes type definitions as well as [TSDocs](https://tsdoc.org/) compatible comments for all exported types, hooks, and components. Our goal is to leverage Intellisense so your developer experience is `a lot` easier.
