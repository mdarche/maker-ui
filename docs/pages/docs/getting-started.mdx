# Getting Started

To begin using Maker UI in your project, install the `maker-ui` dependency from NPM:

```sh
npm i maker-ui
```

The core Maker UI library includes layout components ([Layout API](/docs/layout-api)) as well as basic elements ([Primitives](/docs/primitives)) that you can use as building blocks in your page designs.

<Callout type="alert">
  If you don't want to use the complete Maker UI layout system, you can simply
  install <span>@maker-ui/primitives</span> and import its components as needed.
</Callout>

## Create a Basic Layout

Let's create a basic app layout with the Layout API. In a new component file, add the following:

```jsx
import * as React from 'react'
import {
  Layout,
  Header,
  Navbar,
  MobileMenu,
  Content,
  Main,
  Footer,
} from 'maker-ui'

export const MyLayout = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <Header>
        <Navbar />
        <MobileMenu />
      </Header>
      <Content>
        <Main>{children}</Main>
      </Content>
      <Footer>Footer Copyright</Footer>
    </Layout>
  )
}
```

The JSX from above outputs a semantically structured DOM tree. This example would create a basic single-column page layout, but you can also use Maker UI to construct a variety of common starting points including sidebars, collapsible side navigation, and much more.

## Customize Maker UI Options

The real magic behind Maker UI's layout system is how it supports automatic responsive scaling and accessibility. Let's create an `options` object that will tell our header how it should look and feel on desktop vs mobile:

```jsx {10,13-22,26}
import * as React from 'react'
import {
  Layout,
  Header,
  Navbar,
  MobileMenu,
  Content,
  Main,
  Footer,
  MakerUIOptions, // For TypeScript users
} from 'maker-ui'

const options: MakerUIOptions = {
  header: {
    breakpoint: 1080,
    maxWidth: 960,
    navType: 'center',
    mobileNavType: 'basic',
    sticky: true,
    stickyOnMobile: false,
  },
}

export const MyLayout = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <Layout options={options}>
      <Header>
        <Navbar />
        <MobileMenu />
      </Header>
      <Content>
        <Main>{children}</Main>
      </Content>
      <Footer>Footer Copyright</Footer>
    </Layout>
  )
}
```

Let's unpack this!

Starting on **Line 13**, we create a new `MakerUIOptions` object and add a few settings for the header.

On **Lines 15 and 16**, we tell our header to switch from desktop mode to its mobile layout at `1080px`. The inner contents of our navbar should never exceed a max-width of `960px`.

On **Lines 17 and 18**, we choose from 12 pre-built CSS grid layouts to dictate how our nav will look on desktop and mobile. We can always customize the exact behavior of these layouts later on.

Lastly, on **Lines 19 and 20**, we specify that we want our header to use sticky positioning on desktop and a relative position on mobile.

With the options configuration object, you can control 50+ settings that tell your layout how to behave. You can use `MakerUIOptions` to set color modes, handle error boundaries, configure dropdown menus, and much more. Keep reading through the docs for more examples. For a complete list of layout settings, check out the [Maker UI Options guide](/docs/maker-ui-options).

## Add a Logo and Menu

Now we can import a custom Logo component and create our header navigation menu.

```jsx {11,14-15,28-34,40-41}
import * as React from 'react'
import {
  Layout,
  Header,
  Navbar,
  MobileMenu,
  Content,
  Main,
  Footer,
  MakerUIOptions,
  MakerMenu, // For TypeScript users
} from 'maker-ui'

/* Your custom logo component */
import { Logo } from './Logo'

const options: MakerUIOptions = {
  header: {
    breakpoint: 1080,
    maxWidth: 960,
    navType: 'center',
    mobileNavType: 'basic',
    sticky: true,
    stickyOnMobile: false,
  },
}

/* An array of menu items */
const menu: MakerMenu = [
  { label: 'Home', path: '/' },
  { label: 'About', path: '/about' },
  { label: 'Contact', path: '/contact' },
  { label: 'GitHub', path: 'https://github.com', newTab: true },
]

export const MyLayout = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <Layout options={options}>
      <Header>
        <Navbar logo={<Logo />} menu={menu} />
        <MobileMenu menu={menu} />
      </Header>
      <Content>
        <Main>{children}</Main>
      </Content>
      <Footer>Footer Copyright</Footer>
    </Layout>
  )
}
```

The app is starting to take shape!

Maker UI will add your custom logo to the navbar and create accessible desktop and mobile menus for you.

The `MakerMenu` type is used by all Maker UI components that handle navigation menus. It supports a variety of common conventions including nested submenus, custom class selectors, new tab support, and leading icons.

Learn about Maker UI menus in the [Navbar docs](/docs/navbar).

## Add Custom Styles

Now that we have a responsive layout skeleton, it's time to add some styles to the party.

All Maker UI layout components accept the `css` and `breakpoints` props ([covered here](/docs/styling-components)). However, adding too many styles directly to your layout tree will quickly turn your files into a hot mess of CSS-in-JS.

To address this, Maker UI's root `<Layout>` component accepts a `styles` prop where you can add global styles that are applied to the document head.

<Callout type="info">The styles prop fully supports responsive arrays.</Callout>

```jsx {16-30,34}
import * as React from 'react'
import {
  Layout,
  Header,
  Navbar,
  MobileMenu,
  Content,
  Main,
  Footer,
  MakerUIOptions,
  MakerMenu,
} from 'maker-ui'

...

/* Include global styles in addition to Maker UI layout styles */
const styles = {
  a: {
    textDecoration: 'none',
  },
  header: {
    padding: '10px 30px',
    borderBottom: '1px solid gainsboro',
  },
  footer: {
    display: 'grid',
    gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(4, 1fr)',
    gap: 30,
  }
}

export const MyLayout = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <Layout options={options} styles={styles}>
      <Header>
        <Navbar logo={<Logo />} menu={menu} />
        <MobileMenu menu={menu} />
      </Header>
      <Content>
        <Main>{children}</Main>
      </Content>
      <Footer>
        Footer Copyright
      </Footer>
    </Layout>
  )
}
```

In this example, we add a global `textDecoration` rule to all anchor tags while also applying custom styles to Maker UI's header and footer components.

The easiest way to target a Maker UI layout component (without reading the [Layout API](/docs/layout-api) docs, of course) is to just open DevTools and identify the proper ID or class selector for the job.

## Use Inside a Root Provider

When your new layout is ready to go, import it into your app's root component and treat it like a top-level application provider.

You can use your router's current location to trigger conditional layouts and you can dynamically change your options config or styles as needed.

```jsx
// Basic example
```

Checkout the getting started guides for [NextJS](/docs/nextjs), [Gatsby](/docs/gatsby), or [Create React App](/docs/create-react-app) to learn precisely how to handle this step in your framework of choice.

## Best Practices

In a real application, you would typically store your `options`, `styles`, and `menu` objects in separate files or even generate them dynamically via network requests at build or runtime.

See [Best Practices](/docs/best-practices) for a complete list of helpful tips and common issues.
