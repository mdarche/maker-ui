# Styling Components

All Maker UI components and primitives have special `breakpoints` and `css` props. These props let you specify media query breakpoints as an array of values that correspond with CSS rules.

Here's how the syntax looks in action:

```jsx
/* Set breakpoints to 768px and 960px */

<Div
  breakpoints={[768, 960]}
  css={{
    color: ['blue', 'red', 'purple'],
  }}>
  Hello world
</Div>
```

## Mobile-First Design

Maker UI stacks your CSS array values with **min-width** media queries. In the example above, the div's base color would be `blue`. At `min-width(768px)` the div's color would turn `red`, and finally at `min-width(960px)` the div's color would become `purple`.

<Callout>
  Just remember that the first index of your CSS attribute array will always
  serve as the base style for your component.
</Callout>

Here's another example:

```jsx
/* When the browser's width is >= 1000px, this div will have
 a height of `auto` and a background of `#f9f9f9` */

<Div
  breakpoints={[1000]}
  css={{
    height: [100, 'auto'],
    background: ['#fff', '#f9f9f9'],
    color: '#36748d',
  }}>
  Another div
</Div>
```

## Use Valid CSS Rules

The CSS prop will accept any officially adopted CSS attribute as both a single value or an array of values.

If you need computed styles like a function that returns a style object, just cast your function as an object:

```jsx

function getDynamicStyles() {
  return {
    height: isMobile ? 50 : 100,
    ...
   }
}

/* Type casting an `object` will eliminate TypeScript errors */

<Div
  breakpoints={[960]}
  css={{
    color: 'red',
    ...(getDynamicStyles() as object)
  }}>
  Hello world
</Div>
```

## Nesting Selectors

You can use the CSS prop just like a Sass stylesheet-- nest styles for as many child elements as you'd like. You would simply use the name of the HTML tag or a CSS selector as the key for a child element's style declaration:

```jsx
/* Style nested elements by specifying the name of the HTML element
 or by using an ID or className selector */

<Div
  css={{
    // className selector
    '.red': {
      color: 'red',
    },
    // <section> tag selector
    section: {
      background: '#e6e6e6',
      color: 'blue',
      // ID selector
      '#orange': {
        color: 'orange',
      },
    },
  }}>
  <p className="red">Red text</p>
  <section>
    <p>Blue text</p>
    <p id="orange">Orange text</p>
  </section>
</Div>
```

### Pseudo Selectors

Declare styles for pseudo elements (`:before` and `:after`), state (`hover`, `focus`, `active`, etc.), or chained classes by prefacing the rule with the ampersand `&` symbol:

```jsx
<Button
  className={active ? 'active' : undefined}
  onClick={() => setActive(!active)}
  css={{
    background: '#333',
    '&:hover': {
      background: '#000',
    },
    '&.active': {
      background: '#d6d6d6',
    },
  }}>
  Hover over me
</Button>
```

## When to Inline vs Import

When prototyping, it's often easiest to bake your styles directly into your JSX. This strategy works really well when you can keep your files small with a modular component architecture.

However, if you are building something complex, you may have a hard time identifying your component's business logic when the JSX becomes too bloated with styles. In this case, you should move your styles to a separate object or into a different file all together.

There are 2 patterns for importing styles:

- Scoped styles
- Module styles

### Scoped Styles

With this pattern, you add a nested style declaration to a parent component or JSX element. All child element styles will be derived from the parent's `css` prop. This pattern encourages you to rely more on CSS selectors and natural HTML in your React components.

<Callout>
  This is the recommended way to handle complex component styles because it will
  make your component easier to maintain.
</Callout>

```jsx
import { Div } from 'maker-ui'

const styles = {
  background: '#fff',
  padding: '10px 20px',
  '.card': {
    color: 'tomato',
    border: '1px solid gainsboro',
    margin: [30, 50],
  }
  '.card-title': {
    fontWeight: 700,
    fontSize: [20, 28]
  }
}

/* The styles object is applied to the root <Div /> and all nested elements
are locally scoped */

const TestComponent = () => (
  <Div css={styles}>
    <div className="card">
      <h2 className="card-title">Title</h2>
    </div>
  </Div>
)

```

### Module Styles

This pattern is commonly used in React applications that leverage CSS Modules. You can use a dictionary of style declarations for each Maker UI primitive or component:

```jsx
import { Div, H2 } from 'maker-ui'

const styles = {
  root: {
    background: '#fff',
    padding: '10px 20px',
  },
  card: {
    color: 'tomato',
    border: '1px solid gainsboro',
    margin: [30, 50],
  },
  title: {
    fontWeight: 700,
    fontSize: [20, 28],
  },
}

/* NOTE - You must use a Maker UI component 
to access the CSS prop */

const TestComponent = () => (
  <Div css={styles.root}>
    <Div css={styles.card}>
      <H2 css={styles.title}>Title</H2>
    </Div>
  </Div>
)
```

## \_css Prop

Several Maker UI components render a container with child elements. This is particularly useful for applying a `maxWidth` rule to the component's inner contents or adding a CSS display of `flex` or `grid` to the container.

If you ever need to style a root container element, you can use the `_css` prop.

<Callout>
  To see if a component has a <strong>_css</strong> prop, check out its
  respective documentation page.
</Callout>

## Usage with Layout API

If you decide to use the Layout API in your project, you may never need to add a `breakpoints` prop to any of your components. The `MakerUIOptions` configuration lets you set a global breakpoints array so that all nested components obey the same media queries by default.

When you need a custom media query that is different from the array you specified in your `MakerUIOptions`, the `breakpoints` prop will always take precedence.

### Color Modes and CSS Variables

Unlike other CSS-in-JS libraries, Maker UI relies on CSS variables instead of React Context for theming.

`MakerUIOptions` give you an easy way to define custom variables and themeable color palettes that you can use in your application. Access these values with normal CSS variable syntax:

```jsx
<Div css={{ color: 'var(--color-primary)' }}>Hello world</Div>
```
