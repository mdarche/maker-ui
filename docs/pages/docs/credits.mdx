## Motivation

This library is intended to help React Developers quickly prototype high quality applications apps with a flexible, strong typed layout system. Move from static Figma or Sketch designs to production-grade layouts without the all of the setup headaches.

- No more bloated UI libraries
- Array-based CSS-in-JS media queries
- Build with CSS variables, grid, and flex

The API is simple yet infinitely customizable, allowing you to recreate any app layout you might encounter on the web.

## Shoutouts

Credit is due to 3 awesome projects in the React ecosystem:

#### Emotion

Maker UI has only one critical dependency: [@emotion/react](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion). We build on top of Emotion's `jsx` prop to power our custom JSX factory. Emotion is a performant and flexible CSS-in-JS library that fully supports SSR in addition to runtime styles.

#### React Spring

This library uses pure CSS for almost every transition state, but in some cases we must gracefully mount and unmount components. The optional Popover, Modal, Lightbox, and Carousel components from `@maker-ui/elements` all use the amazing [React Spring](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-spring) library.

#### Theme UI

Maker UI is partly inspired by the innovations of Brent Jacksonâ€™s [Theme UI](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui). Theme UI introduced a responsive `sx` prop with array-based media queries that dramatically improves UI developer experience. Not having to write Sass mixins or a million `@media screen and (min-width: ...)` rules is an incredible boost to responsive website development.
