# Overview

Maker UI is a CSS-in-JS design system that helps you build responsive React apps. Build accessible, production ready layouts in just a few lines of code, or use Maker UI primitives to effortlessly construct responsive components.

## How to Use Maker UI

There are 2 ways to use Maker UI:

- With a Layout Provider
- With CSS-in-JS Primitives

### With a Layout Provider

The Layout provider gives you global control over your app's breakpoints and helps you set CSS variables that you can use throughout your codebase. You can use the Layout API’s semantic components to build conventional or highly custom layouts.

The Layout provider also gives you granular control over the way certain sections of your layout behave. Use a `MakerUIOptions` configuration object alongside a global style object to customize the look and feel of your layout. This pattern makes building custom or conditional layouts extremely quick and easy.

### With CSS-in-JS Primitives

If you want to incrementally introduce Maker UI into your app, or if you just hate media queries and want to use the responsive `css` or `breakpoints` props, you don’t actually need any of the layout components. They will certainly make your life easier, but you might already have a great layout system in place… Don’t fix what’s not broken, right?

Whenever you want to build responsive styles, just import any of the components from `@maker-ui/primitives` or `@maker-ui/components`. They can be used independently of the layout system.

## TypeScript

Maker UI is 100% written in TypeScript and includes type definitions as well as [TSDocs](https://tsdoc.org/) compatible comments for all exported types, hooks, and components.

## Motivation

This library is intended to help React Developers quickly prototype high quality applications apps with a flexible, strong typed layout system. Move from static Figma or Sketch designs to production-grade layouts without the all of the setup headaches.

- No more bloated UI libraries
- Array-based CSS-in-JS media queries
- Build with CSS variables, grid, and flex

The API is simple yet infinitely customizable, allowing you to recreate any app layout you might encounter on the web.

## Shoutouts

Credit is due to 3 awesome projects in the React ecosystem:

#### Emotion

Maker UI has only one critical dependency: [@emotion/react](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion). We build on top of Emotion's `jsx` prop to power our custom JSX factory. Emotion is a performant and flexible CSS-in-JS library that fully supports SSR in addition to runtime styles.

#### React Spring

This library uses pure CSS for almost every transition state, but in some cases we must gracefully mount and unmount components. The optional Popover, Modal, Lightbox, and Carousel components from `@maker-ui/components` all use the amazing [React Spring](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-spring) library.

#### Theme UI

Maker UI is partly inspired by the innovations of Brent Jackson’s [Theme UI](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-ui). Theme UI introduced a responsive `sx` prop with array-based media queries that dramatically improves UI developer experience. Not having to write Sass mixins or a million `@media screen and (min-width: ...)` rules is an incredible boost to responsive website development.
