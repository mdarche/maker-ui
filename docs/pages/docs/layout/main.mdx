<Diagram component="Main">

```jsx
import { Main } from 'maker-ui'
```

</Diagram>

The Main component stores all of your page's main body content in a `<main>` tag. It is used in all Maker UI layouts.

## Width

The width of the Main component is determined by the value of your site's content container that you set as `content.maxWidth` in Maker UI options.

### Full Width Layouts

If you want to use full width backgrounds or background colors throughout your pages, set `content.maxWidth` to `100%` and `options.maxWidthSection` to your desired inner content width. Whenever you want a new full width background, you can import the [Section](/docs/layout/section) component as a section wrapper.

## Props

Main does not have any special props, but you can still add custom `id` and `className` selectors.

| Prop | Description                                                                |
| :--: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| css  | <Type name="object" /> Styles from the `css` prop will be applied to Main. |

## Maker UI Options

For a list of Main-related Maker UI options, see the [Content](/docs/layout/content) component.

## Usage

`Main` is used in all Maker UI layouts. It should always wrap your Layout's `{ children }`.

In addition to the basic configuration below, check out the [Sidebar](/docs/layout/sidebar) and [SideNav](/docs/layout/sidenav) docs:

```jsx
import { Layout, Header, Content, Main, Sidebar } from 'maker-ui'

export const MyLayout = ({ children }) => (
  <Layout>
    <Header />
    <Content>
      <Main>{children}</Main>
    </Content>
  </Layout>
)
```
