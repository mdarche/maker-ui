'@maker-ui/forms': patch
---

This patch version includes a number of small fixes and improvements:

- Date range passes validation with only one date
- Calendar CSS variable names have been fixed to fit MKUI conventions
- New `onPageChange` callback function is available in form.settings for paginated forms
- Only renders the required symbol inside a label if the field is actually required (bugfix)
